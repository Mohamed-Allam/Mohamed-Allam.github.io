denial, we are unable to see the reality of our addiction. We minimize its effect. We
blame others, citing the too-high expectations of families, friends, and employers. We
compare ourselves with other addicts whose addiction seems "worse" than our own. We
may blame one particular drug. If we have been abstinent from drugs for some time, we
might compare the current manifestation of our addiction with our drug use, rationalizing
that nothing we do today could possibly be as bad as that was! One of the easiest ways to
tell that we are in denial is when we find ourselves giving plausible but untrue reasons for
our behavior. ", enableTextarea: true },

certainly qualifies as such an uncontrollable, driving force. We cannot moderate or
control our drug use or other compulsive behaviors, even when they are causing us to
lose the things that matter most to us. We cannot stop, even when to continue will surely
result in irreparable physical damage. We find ourselves doing things that we would
never do if it weren't for our addiction; things that make us shudder with shame when we
think of them. We may even decide that we don't want to use, that we aren't going to use,
and realize we are simply unable to stop when the opportunity presents itself. <br /> am i Powerless ? ", enableTextarea: true },

been cut off from our families, asked never again to contact them.
Inner or personal unmanageability is often identified by unhealthy or untrue belief
Systems about ourselves, the world we live in, and the people in our lives. We may
believe we're worthless. We may believe that the world revolves around us -not just that
it should, but that it does. We may believe that it isn't really our job to take care of
ourselves; someone else should do that. We may believe that the responsibilities the
average person takes on as a matter of course are just too large a burden for us to bear.
We may over or under react to events in our lives. Emotional volatility is often one of the
most obvious ways in which we can identify personal unmanageability. <br /> Do i live in Unmanageability ? ", enableTextarea: true },
